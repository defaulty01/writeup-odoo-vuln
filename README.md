# 3 Core Vulnerabilities on Odoo Framework
During penetration testing, one of our clients is using the Odoo framework. I honestly don’t have any idea on how to use this framework or how this works. I spent 4 days doing recon and research on how to use, create and implement this before I finally have enough knowledge on how Odoo framework works. 
Best part of my research is that I found 3 core vulnerabilities. The bugs are XSS, template injection and local file read. I’ll describe these bugs from least to most interesting parts.
By the way, I deployed Odoo v13 and v15 on my local for comparison and I think it’s good to look for differences between the two versions.
